- GitHub: homeofe/supply-chain-guard (Apache-2.0)
- GitHub Marketplace: supply-chain-guard (GitHub Action)
- ClawHub: not published (CLI tool, not an OpenClaw skill)

### Features (v3.0.0)
- 65+ detection rules across 8 categories
- npm package scanning (install scripts, obfuscation, typosquatting)
- PyPI package scanning with install hook detection (subprocess, base64 exec, cmdclass downloads)
- VS Code extension scanning (.vsix analysis)
- GitHub Actions workflow scanner (CI/CD pipeline attacks, unpinned actions, secrets exfiltration, encoded payloads)
- SARIF 2.1.0 output format for GitHub Code Scanning (`--format sarif`)
- Solana C2 wallet watchlist with persistent monitoring and webhook alerts (`watchlist` commands)
- Dependency confusion detection

- CI workflow (build + test on push/PR, auto-publish to npm on v* tags)

### Architecture
- CLI entry: src/cli.ts (commander-based)
- Core scanner: src/scanner.ts
- Detection modules: src/detectors/*.ts
- GitHub Action: action.yml + src/action.ts

### Open Issues
- dependabot: picomatch 4.0.3 -> 4.0.4 (low priority)

### Known Limitations
- PyPI scanning requires local package download (no remote API)
- VS Code extension scanning needs .vsix file on disk
- No real-time monitoring (scan-based only)
